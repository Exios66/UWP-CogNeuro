## Statistical Analysis Methods

### Statistical Approaches Comparison

|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| General Linear Model (GLM) | Task-based fMRI, EEG/MEG | Well-established, flexible, easy to interpret | Assumes linearity, normality, and independence | SPM, FSL, AFNI |

| Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) | fMRI, EEG/MEG, single-unit | Links neural patterns to theoretical models | Requires well-defined theoretical constructs | RSA Toolbox, PyMVPA |
| Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) | fMRI, EEG/MEG | Can detect distributed patterns of activity | Requires careful cross-validation | PyMVPA, Nilearn, The Decoding Toolbox |
| Granger Causality | Time series data | Tests directional influences | Sensitive to downsampling, hemodynamic variability | MVGC Toolbox, MNE-Connectivity |
| Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) | fMRI, EEG/MEG | Models causal interactions between brain regions | Computationally intensive, requires strong priors | SPM, DCM for MEEG |
| Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling | All neuroscience data | Accounts for hierarchical data structure, incorporates prior knowledge | Computationally intensive, requires explicit models | Stan, JAGS, PyMC |

### Significance Testing in Neuroimaging

#### Multiple Comparisons Problem

When conducting statistical tests across many voxels or sensors, traditional p-value thresholds lead to false positives. Common correction methods include:

| Method | Description | Strengths | Limitations | Implementation |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Bonferroni Correction | Divides alpha by number of tests | Simple, conservative | Often too conservative for neuroimaging | All packages |
| False Discovery Rate (FDR) | Controls proportion of false positives | Less conservative than Bonferroni | Less spatial specificity | fmristat, FSL, SPM |
| Gaussian Random Field Theory | Models spatial correlation of noise | Accounts for spatial smoothness | Assumes data is sufficiently smooth | SPM, FSL |
| Non-parametric Permutation Tests | Empirically derives null distribution | No assumptions about data distribution | Computationally intensive | FSL randomise, SnPM, PALM |
| Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement | Enhances areas of spatial contiguity | No arbitrary cluster threshold | Results depend on smoothing extent | FSL, MNE-Python |

## Machine Learning for Neuroscience

### Unsupervised Learning Methods

| Method | Use Case | Strengths | Limitations | Implementation |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|

| t-SNE | Visualization of high-dimensional neural data | Preserves local structure | Non-deterministic, computationally intensive | scikit-learn, Tensorboard |
| UMAP | Visualization, dimensionality reduction | Faster than t-SNE, preserves global structure | Parameter selection can be challenging | umap-learn |
| Clustering (K-means, hierarchical) | Parcellation, network detection | Intuitive, well-established | Requires predefined number of clusters | scikit-learn, SciPy |
| Autoencoders | Dimensionality reduction, denoising | Can capture non-linear relationships | Requires careful architecture design | TensorFlow, PyTorch |

## Reproducible Analysis Workflows

```python

# Create workflow
wf = pe.Workflow(name='preprocessing')

# Specify data source
datasource = pe.Node(nio.DataGrabber(infields=['subject_id'], outfields=['func', 'struct']), name='datasource')
datasource.inputs.base_directory = '/data'
datasource.inputs.template = '%s/%s.nii.gz'
datasource.inputs.template_args = {'func': [['subject_id', 'func']], 'struct': [['subject_id', 'struct']]}
datasource.inputs.subject_id = 'sub-01'

# Specify processing nodes
bet = pe.Node(fsl.BET(frac=0.5), name='bet')
mcflirt = pe.Node(fsl.MCFLIRT(mean_vol=True, save_plots=True), name='mcflirt')
smooth = pe.Node(fsl.IsotropicSmooth(fwhm=6), name='smooth')

# Connect nodes
wf.connect(datasource, 'struct', bet, 'in_file')
wf.connect(datasource, 'func', mcflirt, 'in_file')
wf.connect(mcflirt, 'out_file', smooth, 'in_file')

# Run workflow
